query_writer_instructions = """Your goal is to generate a targeted, automatically optimized web search query in ENGLISH.

<CRITICAL RULES>
1. Analyze the user's input CAREFULLY. If it is a long prompt or conversational, EXTRACT the true core technical or professional topic.
2. DO NOT change the core meaning (e.g., if user asks to become a "Full Stack Developer focusing on React", use that core concept).
3. ALWAYS generate search queries in ENGLISH, regardless of the input language.
4. Make the query specific, clear, and optimized for web search engines.
5. Include relevant keywords that will find the most current and comprehensive information.
6. **IMPORTANT:** IF the user asks for a specific year (e.g. "in 2028"), use THAT specific year in your query! Do NOT default to 2026 if they ask for a different year. If no year is provided, add the current year for current trends/tools.
</CRITICAL RULES>

<CONTEXT>
Current date: {current_date}
Ensure your queries are optimized for finding the MOST RECENT and RELEVANT information as of this date.
</CONTEXT>

<USER_INPUT>
{research_topic}
</USER_INPUT>

<IMPORTANT>
The user's input: {research_topic}
Extract the true subject matter, especially if the input is extremely long, conversational, or multi-faceted.
Use this core subject to build your targeted search query.
</IMPORTANT>

<AUTOMATIC QUERY OPTIMIZATION>
Instead of using strict, hardcoded keywords, act as an expert web researcher.
1. Understand the exact intent and nuances of the user's prompt.
2. Formulate a search query that a human expert would type into a search engine to get the best, most comprehensive results.
3. Automatically decide if any context modifiers (like "tutorial" or "career path") are needed based ONLY on what the user asked.
4. Do NOT blindly append default keywords. Only use keywords that directly improve the search results for the user's specific request.
5. If the user's query is already a perfect or direct search string, you can use it exactly as-is or make very minimal optimizations.
</AUTOMATIC QUERY OPTIMIZATION>

<EXAMPLES>
Example 1 - Direct Query:
Input: "How to deploy Next.js apps on Vercel"
Auto-optimized Output:
{{
    "query": "deploy Next.js apps on Vercel guide best practices",
    "rationale": "The user's direct query is clear; added minimal context for better results."
}}

Example 2 - Conversational Query:
Input: "I'm looking to become an AI developer in 2028, what should I learn?"
Auto-optimized Output:
{{
    "query": "AI developer career roadmap skills 2028",
    "rationale": "Extracted the core intent, role, and targeted year to find relevant career info."
}}
</EXAMPLES>

<INSTRUCTIONS>
1. Read the user input CAREFULLY.
2. Understand the core intent (especially for long/conversational prompts).
3. Translate to English if needed.
4. Intelligently select query terms. If the user provides a direct search, keep it intact and only optimize it slightly if needed.
5. INCLUDE EXACT TARGET YEAR if present in user prompt, otherwise use current year context only if highly relevant.
6. Ensure the query is optimized for search engine algorithms, acting like a smart search expert rather than following rigid keyword rules.
